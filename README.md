Digital Image Processing Algorithms Dashboard
This project is an interactive web-based dashboard, built with Streamlit, that serves as a comprehensive tool for exploring various digital image processing algorithms. The application allows users to upload an image and apply a wide range of transformations, from fundamental enhancements to advanced compression techniques, all through a user-friendly interface.

Features
Easily navigate and switch between different image processing algorithms. The dashboard covers a broad spectrum of topics, including:

- Image Enhancement: Histogram Equalization, Contrast Stretching, Log and Power Law Transformations.
- Filtering: Blurring, Sharpening, and Noise Simulation/Removal.
- Compression: Run Length Encoding (RLE), Huffman Encoding, and Arithmetic Encoding.
- Geometric Operations: Image Resizing, Scaling, Sampling, Quantization, and Padding.
- Image Flexibility: Load images directly from a URL or a local file path.
